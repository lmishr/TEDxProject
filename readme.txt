Project Description: The name of the term project is Space Raiders. 
The game is in 3D and has a spaceship that the user controls 
with the arrow keys and can shoot bullets by hitting the spacebar. 
There will be enemy spaceships that appear in the screen as well, 
which show up as red cones. The user can shoot these enemies with
the bullets. If an enemy hits the rocket, the user loses a life 
(out of 3). The game ends when the user loses all three lives.
The green cones are speed boosts, the red and yellow spheres are
obstacles (which can't be shot and must be avoided), the blue-gray
squares let the rocket be AI controlled for a few seconds, and the
orange sphere-like objects are coin magnets, which attract coins
to the rocket. The level changes every 1000 distance you travel.
Harder difficult level means more enemies that target you faster.
The game keeps track of high score (max distance traveled and
total amount of coins collected).

You also have a Rocket Buddy, an AI controlled rocket that moves around, 
shoots enemies, and is not harmed by obstacles!

I used the Panda 3D module. To run the game, you need to get to the
file directory that has the python file "Rocket.py", then run "python
Rocket.py" in the command prompt.
NOTE: in order to run this project, you need to have Panda3D installed!
